    <h2>Yamina Hamilton</h2>
 <p>I’m Yamina i  am a student attending westside academy, I am experienced with the Adobe Suite, screen printing, and drawing techniques. I am a proud winner in Skills USA with my animation team. Together,  we presented our work in Lansing, MI as a part of the pathway showcase.
 </p>
<p>I love my work because it’s a chance to see how others see view the world and how they plan on making their mark  and I plan on helping them succeed in doing so. I help break down things for a company  such as how things could work,
